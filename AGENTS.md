## Commit Message Guidance

### Guidelines

- Only generate the message for staged files/changes
- Title is lowercase, no period at the end.
- Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.
- Use the body to explain _why_ and the main areas changed, not just _what_.
- Bullet points should be concise and high-level.
- Try to use the ideal format. But if the commit is too broad or has too many different types, then use the borad format.
- When committing changes from TODO or task list that is already part of the repo and has phases, make refernce to the file and phase instead of writing a long commit message.
- Add a commit body whenever the staged change is not trivially small.
- A body is expected when the commit:
  - touches more than 3 files
  - touches more than one package or app
  - includes both implementation and tests
  - adds a new route, component, workflow, or integration point
- For broader commits, the title can stay concise, but the body should summarize the main change areas so a reader can understand scope without opening the diff.
- Do not use the body as a file inventory. Summarize the logical changes in 2-5 bullets.

### Format
